# Titanic Data Analysis with Power BI  

## Description  
This project provides an in-depth analysis of the Titanic dataset using **Power BI**. The dataset was **cleaned, formatted, and visualized** to uncover insights about passengers aboard the Titanic. The analysis answers key questions regarding passenger demographics, class distribution, fare prices, and relationships on board.  

## Data Processing  
- **Data Cleaning**: The dataset was imported into **Power BI**, where missing values were handled, data was formatted, and necessary transformations were applied.  
- **Data Analysis**: Visualizations and calculations were created to answer key questions about the passengers.  

## Key Questions Answered  
1. **Total Passengers**: How many passengers were aboard the Titanic?  
2. **Passenger Class Distribution**: How many passengers were in each class?  
3. **Gender Breakdown**: How many passengers were male and female?  
4. **Age Grouping**: Passengers were categorized into four groups:  
   - 0–19: Teenagers  
   - 20–39: Youth
